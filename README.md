## Dotfiles

# Dotbot

Dotbot makes installing dotfiles super simple. Add files to the `dotfiles` directory and update the
`install.config.yaml` file. Once done, run `./install` from within the parent directory of this
project.

If you need to make updates to the dotfiles, simply make your changes, commit them, and then re-run
`./install`.
