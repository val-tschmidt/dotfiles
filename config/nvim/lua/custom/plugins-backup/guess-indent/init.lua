-- Blazing fast indentation style detection for Neovim written in Lua. The goal
-- of this plugin is to automatically detect the indentation style used in a
-- buffer and updating the buffer options accordingly. This mimics the "Guess
-- Indentation Settings From Buffer" function built into Sublime Text.
